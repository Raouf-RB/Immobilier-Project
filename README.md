- Manage different types of properties (villa, apartment, etc.)
- Agent and appointment management
- Modular and structured OOP architecture in Java

## Technologies

- Java
- JDK 17+
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 17 or higher
- Terminal or Java IDE (IntelliJ, Eclipse, etc.)

### Steps

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `src` folder:
   ```bash
